**Random Colour Generator**

This started as a simple tutorial to practice DOM manipulation using javascript.

The original tutorial from Colt Steele's Udemy course

After completing the tutorial I felt it was easy enough to generate the complimentary colour to the random colour.

I then added css to style.
